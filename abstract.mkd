This document proposes extensions to the DNS protocol to provide an
incremental zone transfer (IXFR) mechanism that is DNSSEC aware. 
By adding the DNSSEC awareness it is possible to reduce the size of 
Incremental zone transfers by about half. In this draft two 
possible approaces are examined. A minimalistic changes one that
is more compatible with dynamic update, and a radical one that 
is has potential for more savings and potential for more rapid zone
disemenation.
